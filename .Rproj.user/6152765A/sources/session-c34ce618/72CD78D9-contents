Description: PREDICTbreastML implements an updated machine-learning version of the PREDICT breast cancer prognostic framework. Trained and validated on the largest and most diverse SEER cohort, the package applies population reweighting, treatment-effect modeling, and modern survival-learning methods to improve accuracy and fairness. It uses key demographic, tumor, and treatment variables to estimate breast cancer–specific, other-cause, and all-cause mortality. The package also provides individualized estimates of chemotherapy benefit. PREDICTbreastML offers a robust and reproducible tool for breast cancer risk prediction and treatment decision support.
